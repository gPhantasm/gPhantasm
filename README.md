## Hello!

I am a student currently studying for an undergraduate degree in computer science! 

While this Github is mostly for private repos of my course notes and assignments, there are some cool things like

- amateur [GML hacks](https://github.com/gPhantasm/zeroranger-green-arrange/)
- a [strange port](https://github.com/EzDzzIt/vsaarch64/tree/main)
- hopefully more in the future!
