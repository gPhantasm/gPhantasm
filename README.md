## Hello!

I am a student currently studying for an undergraduate degree in computer science!

While this Github is mostly for private repos of my course notes and assignments, there are still some cool personal projects worth perusing:

- [an arm64 port of a strange game](https://github.com/EzDzzIt/vsaarch64)
- [a little Godot game about little guys](https://github.com/KupaJablek/little_guys)
- [a robust musicpack for _ZeroRanger_](https://github.com/gPhantasm/zeroranger-green-arrange/tree/main)

If you need to reach me, send me a message on Discord `gooeyphantasm`.
