## Hello!

I am a student currently studying for an undergraduate degree in computer science!

While this Github is mostly for private repos of my course notes and assignments, there are some cool things like

- a [strange port](https://github.com/EzDzzIt/vsaarch64/tree/main)
- amateur [GML hacks](https://github.com/gPhantasm/zeroranger-green-arrange/)
- hopefully more in the future!

If you need to reach me, send me a message on Discord `gooeyphantasm`.
